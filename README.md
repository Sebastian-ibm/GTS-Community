# Welcome to the Technical Leaders - GTS DACH Community


In IBM GTS we provide a broad range of career opportunities for Technical Professionals in the following professions:

IT Architect, IT Specialist, IT Consultant, Service Solution Manager, Project Manager and Senior Technical Staff Members. A typical career path is to become accredited in a profession, then senior certified and finally thought leader certified. 

We have launched the Technical Leaders Initiative to further foster a group among those Technical Professionals who demonstrate outstanding/ exceptional technical leadership in client projects.

As we are currently in the middle of a major transformation, technical leadership is absolutely critical to successfully master this transformation and to continue to win in the marketplace.

 

This Initiative is designed to identify and develop our best Technical Leaders in GTS DACH

 

What's in it for you - the Technical Leader?

 

The Technical Leaders Initiative is designed to help you drive your career forward. Within the Technical Leaders Initiative you will have increased visibility to GTS Executive management team. GTS Executive management team will get to know who you are and what your specific skills are that can help to successfully master technical complexity in client projects. This will be facilitated for example through roundtables with BU Leaders, client interactions, regular development discussions with your Business Unit Technical Leader and possibility to present individual projects or evolving new technical trends to the GTS Leadership Team.

 

Within the Technical Leaders initiative you will also have increased opportunity to network with other members of the Technical Leaders Initiative. This will enable you to reach out more easily to other Technical Leaders in case you need their support in complex x-disciplinary client projects. We will support this through regular interactions within the Technical Leaders community or by giving recommendations for relevant give-back activities, e.g. participation in TEC or Academy activities.

 

Within the Technical Leaders Initiative every member will have a focused personal development plan including relevant master classes. Furthermore you will get a Technical Leader mentor and have yourself the chance to act as mentor for our Technical Leader Pipeline.

 

The GTS DACH leadership team is not only fully supporting this initiative, they have also clearly articulated what they expect from our technical leaders.

 
	
Technical Leaders are visible within GTS and in front of the Clients. 	Technical Leaders are trusted. They take responsibility and are helpful and approachable.

 
	

Technical Leaders have drive and insight. They are passionate and committed to succeed.
	Technical Leaders connect with others.They effectively use a network, can be found and actively share their expertise with others.

 

 

The initiative has the 5P's in focus:

Within the technical leaders community we - the People -  will discuss our Priorities, identify opportunities for Process improvements, drive Portfolio development with a focus on improving Performance - our's, IBM's and our client's!

 

To support the technical leaders during different phases of their careers we are introducing three pools:

    Technical Leaders Pipeline
    Technical Leaders
    Top Technical Leaders

This will allow us to align the development activities with specific offerings according the level of seniority. However, this does not mean that we will separate the pools. One of the major design goal is to keep transparency and to foster communication between the members of the respective communities. See details for all pools below.
